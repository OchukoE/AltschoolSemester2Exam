                <h1>Welcome to Ochuko Landing Page</h1>
                <p>The objective of this task is to set up a web server and deploy a simple landing page to demonstrate your team's capabilities to potential investors. To achieve this, you will provision a Linux server on a cloud platform like AWS, install a web server such as Apache or Nginx, and create a basic HTML page that includes your name, a project title (“Welcome to [Your Name] Landing Page”), a brief project description, and your full bio with interesting details. Once the HTML page is created, you will deploy it on the server, configure the server to allow HTTP traffic on port 80, and provide the public IP address or URL so the page can be accessed from any browser. Deliverables include the public IP address or URL of your web page, a screenshot showing your HTML page in a browser, and clear, step-by-step documentation in a README.md file hosted in a Git repository, detailing how you provisioned the server, installed the web server, deployed the HTML page, and configured networking. For extra credit, you can optionally configure HTTPS for your web server using a free SSL certificate like Let’s Encrypt.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name Ochuko Egesi, ALT ID <strong>ALT/SOE/024/0546</strong>. 
                I am a graduate of Afe Babalola University, where I studied Biochemistry.
                I am from Delta State, Urhobo by tribe. 
                I started in the world of nursing driven by passion to care for people and make a difference in their lives but as I worked my way through the healthcare system, I realised there was so much more I wanted to do.
                I began to see how technology could be a game changer in healthcare and that's when I started exploring the world of technology and eventually found myself drawn to cloud engineering. 
                I could see  the potential for cloud technology to revolutionalise not just healthcare but other industries.
                I am currently enrolled as a student at AltSchool Africa Engineering Karatu 2024, Cloud Engineering track.
                My goal in this program is to learn everything I can about cloud infrastructure and services, and how to use them to build efficient, secure, and scalable systems.</p>
